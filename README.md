This project, though not heavily tech-based, had a significant impact and offered immense learning opportunities. It involved a business intelligence initiative during my internship, where I collaborated with my team to gather information on companies listed on AfterShip, aiming to build a database for internal analysis.

My role was to collect and digitize this company data. Recognizing an opportunity to speed up and scale the process, I proposed to my supervisor that we web scrape AfterShip, which listed thousands of businesses. Leveraging my full-stack web development background, I quickly learned Python web scraping with Selenium to navigate the site. The challenge was that the data spanned across multiple pages and required understanding complex, nested HTML structures rather than being available in a single dataset.
